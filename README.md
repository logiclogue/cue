# Cue

A command-line text editor

## Compiling

Just type `make`

## Usage

- `./build/cue` will run the tests
- `./build/cue README.md` will open this very file for editing!
- `./build/cue Makefile` to open the makefile, you get the idea

- Pressing the **escape** saves and quits the editor
- Pressing Ctrl+C quits the editor without saving

## Issues

- Not being able backspace the last character
- Not being able to put the cursor on the right side of the last character
- File becomes slower to edit, the further through the file you go
